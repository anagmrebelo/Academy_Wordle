# Wordle Game - React App

## Overview
Wordle is a word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a five-letter word within five attempts. Each guess is checked against the target word, and feedback is provided to help the player narrow down their choices. It's a fun and engaging way to test your vocabulary and word-solving skills.

## How to Play
**Objective:** The goal of the game is to guess the secret five-letter word.

**Guessing Rules:** You have five attempts to guess the word. Each guess must be a valid five-letter English word with no repeated letters.

**Feedback:** After each guess, you'll receive feedback on the correctness of your guess:

**Correct Letter and Position:** If a letter is in the target word and appears in the correct position, it will be marked as green.

**Correct Letter, Wrong Position:** If a letter is in the target word but appears in the wrong position, it will be marked as yellow.

**Incorrect Letter:** If a letter is not in the target word, it will be marked as gray.

**Process:** Use the feedback from previous guesses to eliminate possibilities and make educated guesses in subsequent attempts.

**Winning:** If you guess the word correctly within five attempts, you win the game!
